      <h2 class="heading__h2" style="text-align: left;">Eduten Ltd Data Processing Terms</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        <i>Version: Feb 14, 2018</i>
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">Applicability</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">These terms become applicable between Eduten and a customer with whom Eduten has concluded an
        agreement if Eduten is considered as data processor and customer a data controller in the meaning as given in EU
        General Data Protection Regulation. These terms may become applicable between Eduten and its reseller, if Eduten
        acts in the role of a sub-processor to a reseller who is a processor to its own end-customer. In that case
        “controller” refers to the reseller and “processor” to Eduten as a sub-processor of the reseller.</p>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Definitions</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">The terms used herein shall have the same meaning as given in Regulation 2016/679 of the
        European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of
        personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (the “Regulation”). Such
        terms include without limitation controller, processor, personal data, data subject, processing and personal
        data breach.</p>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Purpose</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">With these terms, the parties agree that customer, the controller, appoints Eduten as its
        processor to process customer’s personal data during the term of an agreement under the terms agreed herein.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Processor shall process the personal data only to further its obligations set forth in an
        agreement and in accordance with the written instructions provided by controller.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Controller shall be the sole controller for the personal data and shall be responsible for
        complying with the obligations the Regulation and other applicable laws set for data controllers, such as
        ensuring that there is a legal basis for processing personal data, informing data subjects about processing
        activities with privacy policies, complying with other controller’s documentation obligations and ensuring that
        the data is kept accurate. If and to the extent the legal basis for processing personal data is individual’s
        consent, the controller is liable for obtaining the consent and managing it as provided in the Regulation.
        Controller is liable for the data entered into processor’s services and its lawfulness, as it has sole control
        over such data.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Processor is not entitled to process personal data for any other purpose or for anyone else.
        If processor transfers data outside the EU/EEA processor must comply with the obligations that the Regulation
        specifies for international transfers. Processor must immediately notify controller, if it considers that the
        written instructions provided by controller for processing personal data are in violation of the Regulation or
        national data protection laws. In addition to the terms of this annex, the parties agree to comply with the
        Regulation as applicable to each party.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Additional details regarding processing may be described in the agreement or in a separate
        document.</p>


      <h4 class="heading__h4">Sub-processing</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">Processor is entitled to use sub-processors for processing personal data. Additional
        information about sub-processors can be provided at request. If the processor plans to make changes to its
        sub-processors, it will notify the controller by giving at least 7 days written notice. Processor’s obligation
        to notify concerns intended adding, removal or change of a sub-processor. After receiving notification,
        controller has the right to object the intended change in the use of a sub-processor. If the controller objects
        the intended change and the data processor cannot reasonably use another sub-processor or another method in
        processing the personal data, then the processor is not liable for damages or harm caused by such objection. In
        this situation the processor is entitled to terminate the agreement by giving at least 1-month’s written notice
        to the controller.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">When using sub-processors for processing personal data, processor agrees that it will impose
        data protection terms on any sub-processor it appoints that protect the personal data to the same standard as
        provided for by this Annex. Processor is fully liable that its sub-processors comply with the requirements of
        this Annex.</p>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Confidentiality</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">All personal data processed by processor on behalf of controller is considered controller’s
        confidential information and processor shall not disclose the personal data to anyone or use it for any other
        than agreed purpose. Processor ensures that only such people shall have access to the personal data that is
        necessary for furthering processor’s obligations relating to the purpose and that such people shall be subject
        to a strict duty of confidentiality, contractual or statutory, and shall not permit any person to process the
        personal who is not under such a duty of confidentiality. The duties of confidentiality shall survive the
        termination or expiration of the Agreement.</p>


      <h4 class="heading__h4">Security</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">Processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the
        personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access
        to the personal data. Such measures shall take into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation
        and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity
        for natural persons’ rights and freedoms.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Such measures can include, as appropriate:
      </p>

      <ul class="list margin-bottom-3">
        <li class="list__item">the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;</li>
        <li class="list__item">the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience
          of processing systems and services;</li>
        <li class="list__item">the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in
          the event of a physical or technical incident;</li>
        <li class="list__item">a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical
          and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.</li>

      </ul>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Personal data breaches</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">Processor must notify controller without undue delay about personal data breaches it becomes
        aware of, so that controller can comply with the provisions of the Regulation regarding personal data breach
        notifications within the set time limits. When notifying controller, processor must include necessary details
        about the personal data breach and also otherwise provide reasonable assistance for the controller. Processor
        must also take all such other necessary measures to mitigate or remedy the effects of the personal data breach
        and to prevent further breaches.</p>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Data protection impact assessment</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">If processor becomes aware that the planned processing would cause a high risk for the rights
        and freedoms of natural persons it must notify controller about this and assist the controller, if necessary, in
        conducting a data protection impact assessment.
      </p>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Data subject's rights</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">Taking into consideration the nature of the data processing, processor must reasonably and
        without undue delay assist controller, including by applicable technical and organisational measures, to fulfill
        any request from a data subject to exercise its rights under the Regulation. Such rights may include, as they
        are described in the Regulation, rights of access, correction, objection, erasure (“right to be forgotten”) and
        data portability. If such requests are made directly to processor, it must notify controller about the request
        without undue delay.

      </p>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Audits</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">Processor shall permit controller to audit processor’s compliance with these terms, and shall
        provide access and make available to controller all systems, premises, resources, information and staff as
        necessary for controller to conduct such audit. Audits will be performed during normal business hours with the
        aim of causing as little disruption to processor’s business operation as reasonably possible. Controller must
        also provide reasonable advance notification of planned audits. Both parties are responsible for their own costs
        and expenses relating to an audit.</p>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Other terms</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">If the processor must assist the controller in fulfilling the controller’s obligations
        related to data breaches, data subjects’ rights and data protection impact audits, the processor is entitled to
        invoice the reasonable actual time used for the assistance tasks in accordance with the hourly rates agreed
        between the parties. Invoicing the time used for the assistance tasks requires that the controller has accepted
        that the processor can use time to perform assistance tasks.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Processor is not liable to the controller for any indirect, consequential or special damages
        or for claims made by third parties. The liability of processor to controller in respect of any claim for loss,
        damage, cost or expense that is attributable to a specific order, shall in no event exceed in the aggregate a
        sum equal to 30 % of the amount paid by controller for the services (excluding VAT) relating to the order.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Regarding services or software that is invoiced (or priced) on a monthly basis, processor’s
        liability to controller in respect for any claim for loss, damage, cost or expense shall not exceed in aggregate
        the sum paid by the customer (excl. VAT) for the services or software within the 2-month period prior to making
        first claim for damages.</p>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Term and effects of termination</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">These terms into force on the same date as the agreement between the parties and shall
        thereafter remain in force until the agreement is terminated or expires under its terms.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Within a reasonable time after the termination or expiration of the agreement, processor
        shall delete or return all personal data to controller and delete also all copies of the personal data, unless
        national or EU or member state law requires processor to retain some or all of that data. In such event any
        further processing of the personal data is prohibited, except to the extent required by law. The controller is
        obligated to make sure that it has backup copies of the data prior to deletion, if it considers the data still
        necessary.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">If the controller has not notified the processor about deletion or return of data within 12
        months from the termination or expiration of the agreement, the processor shall delete all personal data in its
        possession, including any copies, unless national or EU or member state law requires processor to retain some or
        all of that data. In such event any further processing of the personal data is prohibited, except to the extent
        required by law. The controller is obligated to make sure that it has backup copies of the data prior to
        deletion, if it considers the data still necessary.</p>
