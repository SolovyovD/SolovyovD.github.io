      <h2 class="heading__h4">For what purposes is personal data collected and used and what is the legal basis for
        processing personal data?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">We collect, store and process personal data only for predefined purposes. We also always make
        sure that there is at least one legal basis for processing personal data. The main purposes and the applicable
        legal basis for processing personal data are:</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Provision of service.</strong> Personal data is collected and used for managing the
        entire customer relationship and providing our digital service. This may include for instance user
        authentication and invoicing. The legal basis for this processing is a contract between Eduten and the customer.
        The legal basis for some processing may also be consent (children) or express consent (health data).</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Marketing.</strong> We also collect and use personal data for marketing purposes,
        including direct marketing and contacting potential customers. We may also use personal data to target or
        retarget advertising in digital media platforms, such as social media and search engines. The legal basis for
        this processing is our legitimate interest. A person can however at any point prohibit direct marketing by
        sending email to info@eduten.com. We do not sell or rent personal data to third parties for marketing purposes.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Customer communications.</strong> We also collect and use personal data for customer
        communication purposes, including handling of support requests and customer feedback as well as notifying users
        about the service. The legal basis for this processing is fulfilling contractual obligations as well as our
        legitimate interest.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Analytics and business development.</strong> We also use anonymized data for
        statistical and research purposes. This is mainly data that is generated during the use of our service. This
        anonymized data may be transferred to third parties, such as educational organizations and institutions for the
        purpose of educational analysis and development. This may be done in the form of reports provided to our
        customers. We also use the personal data as well as the anonymized data generated from the use of our service to
        develop our own digital service. The legal basis for this processing is mainly our legitimate interest.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Human resources management. Personal data relating to employees and job applicants are mainly collected and used
        for human resources management purposes, payment of salaries, fulfilling other rights and obligations relating
        to employment contracts, meeting legal requirements relating to employment as well as evaluating and selecting
        candidates for open positions. The legal basis for this processing may be fulfilling a contract between Eduten
        and the employee, consent (job applicants) as well as fulfilling legal obligations relating to employment.
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">
        What personal data is collected and from which sources?
      </h4>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The personal data we collect and use is mainly provided by the person herself. Another important source is the
        data created and generated during the use of our digital service. Regarding potential organizational customers,
        we could also get information from public sources, such as LinkedIn. We also collect website use and visitor
        information with Google Analytics and HubSpot for analyzing our website use, develop it further and for
        targeting relevant marketing content for our customers and website visitors.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph"><i>Data we collect and process relating to our customers:</i> Name of the organization,
        person’s name, business contact details and similar data.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><i>Data we collect and process relating to teachers:</i> Name, school or educational
        institution, email address and similar data.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><i>Data we collect and process relating to students:</i> Data is divided into personal data
        and research data. Personal data is data that teachers need to generate reports. It contains for instance user
        login, name of the person and date of birth. Research data contains data that is generated when the student uses
        the service (e.g. what assignments the student did as well as the results) and classification data relating to
        the student. Research data contains for instance age in months, gender and country. Research data alone is
        anonymous data.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><i>Data we collect and store relating to potential customers:</i> Name, email, employer, job
        title and similar data.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><i>Data we collect and store relating to employees:</i> Name and contact details, social
        security number, email and details required for payment of salaries and withholding taxes.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><i>With consent we may also process:</i> Personal data of users under 16 years with consent
        from parents, and health data relating to user’s learning process and performance.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Note that our customers may use the service for storing and processing their and their users'
        personal data, so in those situations we operate as their data processor based on contracts. In such situation
        we process personal data only on behalf of the specific customer based on their instructions and only as long as
        we have a valid contract.</p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">Information regarding children</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">A contract regarding the use of our service can also be made with an educational institution
        and its representative, who is authorized to make contracts on behalf of the specific organization. This person
        must be at least 18 years old and in a relevant position in the organization. However, users of our service may
        also be students who are under 16 years old.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">If Eduten offers its digital service directly to children under 16 years (or a lower age
        limit, if so provided by national local law) and processes personal data relating to children based on consent,
        it will make sure that the consent is given or authorized by a person with parental responsibility for the
        child. We may also process personal data relating to children who are users or students based on our legitimate
        interest, which is the provision of our digital service to users.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">If Eduten’s customer has users or otherwise enters personal data relating to children in the
        digital service and the customer is considered as data controller for this personal data, it is customer’s
        responsibility to ensure that there is lawful basis for processing the personal data.</p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">Who processes personal data and is it transferred to anyone?</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">Personal data is mainly stored in electronic format and people within our organization have
        access to personal data.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">We may also use third party services providers for data storage (e.g. cloud storage), digital
        marketing and processing of personal data. In these situations, we make sure we have a written contract with the
        services provider with minimum data processing provisions and also otherwise that the confidentiality of
        personal data is secured and data is otherwise processed and transferred lawfully.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">We may also disclose or transfer personal data to fulfill legal obligations or when a legal
        authority requires a disclosure. We may also disclose personal data if we are a party of a business sale, such
        as a merger or an acquisition.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">If any of our services providers or data transferees are located outside the EU, we make sure
        that the transfer of data fulfills all legal requirements.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">We may also transfer to third parties (mainly customers and educational institution)
        anonymized or statistic data, from where it is not possible to identify a person. If this kind of data is no
        longer considered personal data, we may provide the data to third parties also for other purposes than those
        described in this privacy policy.</p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">Is personal data transferred outside the EU?</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">By default, personal data is not transferred outside the EU. In certain limited situations,
        data may be transferred outside the EU if our services provider is located there.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">If personal data is transferred outside the EU, we make sure that the transferee is located
        in a country with adequate safeguards (as decided by the EU commission from time to time), the transferee is
        Privacy Shield certified (if a US-based company) or the transfer occurs by using model clauses published by the
        EU commission.</p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">How long is data stored?</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">We will not store personal data for a longer period than is necessary for its purpose or
        required by contract or law. The storage times for personal data may vary based on its purpose and the
        situation. Data may also be deleted after a contract ends with the customer.</p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">How is data stored and kept secure?</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">Personal data is stored and secured in accordance with general industry standards and
        practices. We consider and keep personal data confidential. Subcontractors that we use for processing personal
        data are selected also based on their data security measures. For our own systems and data storage, we use only
        well established services providers and robust software tools. Access to personal data is also protected with
        user-specific logins, passwords and user rights. Our premises are also safe and secure.</p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">Is it mandatory to provide personal data? What happens if you don’t provide it?</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">If you as a customer, user or employee do not provide us some of your personal data or allow
        processing of it, it is very likely that we cannot serve and fulfil the purpose of our business. At least
        entirely. At minimum, we need to process personal data relating to employment and for provision of our service
        to customers with whom we have a contract.</p>
