      Eduten and <a href="https://domoderefontiro.be" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener" class="paragraph__link">Domo de Refontiro</a> have entered
      into a partnership with the aim of making Finland’s most popular digital
      mathematics learning platform available for the Flemish and Dutch
      educational scene. This platform, called Eduten Playground, is a gamified
      and adaptive AI-based system that comes with a content library of more
      than 200,000 pedagogically high quality online tasks for students between
      the ages of 6 to 15.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Eduten Playground was developed at the <a href="https://utu.fi/en"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="paragraph__link">University of
      Turku</a>, which is one of the 1% best ranked universities in the world,
      in close collaboration with hundreds of Finnish teachers. It provides
      significant proven improvements to learning outcomes, teacher wellbeing
      and student motivation. It also decreases math anxiety. These benefits
      have been proven by dozens of peer-reviewed scientific studies over the
      past 15 years.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">

      The platform not only saves teachers' precious time, but also
      offers opportunities for setting up highly differentiated approaches and
      even individual learning pathways.  The teacher remains at the steering
      wheel at all times, and receives high quality learning analytics that help
      provide better support for each student in less time through
      scientifically proven exercises and an extensive content library that is
      available to all teachers.

    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">


      Eduten Playground platform has proved its worth as a scientifically
      validated exercise platform by more than 13,000 Finnish teachers since
      2011 and is also used in 40+ countries worldwide, including Hong Kong,
      Sweden, the United Kingdom, Australia, US, various countries in Europe,
      Asia and Latin America, and hence from now on also in Belgium and the
      Netherlands.

    <p class="paragraph">

      Henri Muurimaa, CEO, Eduten: <i>“Together with Domo de Refontiro we ran an
      extensive pilot in 11 schools to measure Eduten Playground’s impact and
      usefulness in Belgian schools. The pilot ran very smoothly and we received
      wonderful results and feedback from the participating students and
      teachers. Domo de Refontiro is a great partner for us and we are looking
      forward to providing the benefits of Eduten Playground to many schools
      together with them.”</i>

    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Christel Ruttens, CEO, Domo de Refontiro and Pieter Sprangers; Head
      Designer at Domo de Refontiro: <i>“More than 1 ½ years ago we started an
      exciting journey together with our Eduten partners, curious about how
      Belgian school teachers and students would react towards the introduction
      of this wonderful digital AI-based math learning platform. We were struck
      by the excellent educational value of the platform and how the teachers
      and the students enthusiastically embraced it.”</i>
