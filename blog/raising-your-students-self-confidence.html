      <img src="/img/grandmother-1807515.jpg" alt="Student with laptop and his grandmother" class="paragraph__img">A
      teacher named
      Dan received feedback from one of his previous students: “You saw the potential in me from the beginning. The fact
      that you believed in means a learner had huge meaning for me. It really boosted my self-confidence and
      resilience.” That was feedback after 20 years.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      One of Dan’s strongest qualities as a teacher is that he always believes in his people. He believes that with
      encouragement and responsibility, anyone can be a good learner. Dan knows how to support kids and the growth of
      their positive self-image as a father figure and a teacher.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Unfortunately some teachers tend to do the opposite. Sometimes I run into teachers and parents who don’t believe
      in their students. I often hear them say things like, “The kids in my class are this and that… They are lazy and
      don’t take responsibility for their own school stuff.”
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">And when I meet ‘these people’ I often realize they are nothing like persons described by their
      leaders. They are not lazy – they were just not mentored with the same kind of “Dan’s” attitude.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Dan’s strength as a teacher is his understanding of the meaning of creating the right class
      spirit and how it supports a successful learning.</p>

      People have different types of psychological dimensions. The term PsyCap by Fred Luthans and backed by over 30
      years of research, consists of four dimensions: hope, realistic optimism, resilience and self-efficacy. This is
      the so called HERO-model.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">It has been proven that poor teaching and parenting can diminish a classroom’s attitude and
      affect potential utilisation of people’s strengths. The best way to develop kids is to lead student’s learning
      attitude and motivate them to learn in new ways.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Five ways a teacher can develop Student’s Self-Confidence and Learning Attitude are:</p>

    <p class="paragraph paragraph__strong">1. Check your ego at the door:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The classrooms’s attitude always partly mirrors that of its teacher’s own attitude.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph__strong">Ask yourself:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">What Confidence and Attitude am I reflecting?</p>
    <p class="paragraph">How can I strengthen my own attitude?</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph__strong">2. Believe in your students:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Teachers need to cultivate confidence in their students and help them to cultivate their
      strengths. One of my old teachers once said, “Every person we teach is an uncut diamond. A teacher’s job is to
      encourage every individual and help them to see their own skills and potential.”</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph__strong">Ask yourself:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">How can I help my students to find (and use) their strengths?</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Which of my beliefs are undermining the learning, growth and success of others?</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph__strong">3. Let go</p>
    <p class="paragraph">If you want students to learn to take responsibility, you need to give up control. Let them
      make decisions about how to learn and decide on their own study breaks. Don’t be a micromanaging teacher.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph__strong">Ask yourself:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">How can my students exercise individual responsibility in the classroom?</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph__strong">4. Don’t be afraid of praise and gratitude:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Some of us believe that compliments and recognition make kids arrogant or perhaps even lazy. Of
      course this is possible but it’s highly unlikely. You are better off taking this small risk and believing in the
      potential they have instead of ignoring it.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">However, don’t be afraid to give negative feedback aloud (in a positive and respectful manner).
      Speak from the heart and give constructive feedback. Show an understanding of factors that might have contributed
      to missteps but at the same time challenge the person to see the weak links that can be developed.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph__strong">Ask yourself:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">When and how did you last show gratitude to a classroom member?</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph__strong">5. Cultivate a team learning environment:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Let you kids talk to each other every now and then. Communication between students is a really
      effective way of learning. Try to create a team learning culture. Team learning is accelerated learning.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph__strong">Ask yourself:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">What kind of learning example and use of your own potential have you showed over the past year?
