      Artificial intelligence is a hot topic in many areas and education is no exception. A wave of new kind of AI-based
      digital methods is arising to improve both teaching and learning, but how does it all work exactly? What’s in it
      for teachers and students? What is required to gain the benefits? Read on for a non-technological idea on how AI
      can be applied to learning and education.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading__h2 heading__light">AI Is Not Required For Adaptive Learning</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      All learners are unique, and it’s true that there can be no fixed learning path that works well for every student.
      You may have heard how AI in learning is all about adapting learning paths to the individual learner’s needs. As
      it turns out, adaptive learning is nothing new and it does not require AI or other technological solutions. We
      already have this wonderful glue that just makes everything work by adapting curriculums and learning paths for
      individual learners: <strong>teachers.</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      <img src="/img/teacher_and_student_3.jpg" alt="Teacher helping his student"
        class="paragraph__img paragraph__img__right">Teachers get to
      know their students and learn the unique properties of each. Using this insight they guide each student through
      their learning paths. Another term for this is <strong>differentiation</strong> and today it’s based on teachers’
      professional
      evaluation of students and materials. Differentiation can have <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED510605"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="paragraph__link">a big impact</a> on student engagement and motivation.
      Traditional teacher-driven differentiation has its challenges, however. Teachers can’t learn or observe all
      aspects of every student, and not all learning materials lend themselves to easy differentiation.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      And this is where AI can help.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading__h2 heading__light">Machine Learning Is Not Magic</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <img src="/img/artificial-intelligence.jpg" alt="Artificial intelligence" class="paragraph__img">
      There are many ways to define what artificial intelligence means, but for our purposes it is enough to say that AI
      is very good at recognising patterns in data. That’s all there is to it, really. The human brain is excellent at
      pattern recognition as well, but unlike humans, computers do not have practical limits on the complexity and
      amount of data they can consider.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Another advantage AI has over humans is that they are able to stay objective while we are prone to
      <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-cognitive-bias-2794963" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
        class="paragraph__link"> many types of cognitive biases</a>. Whatever
      patterns an AI does or doesn’t recognise comes purely from the data it is given. The
      other side of the coin is that AIs are completely dependent on the data they work on. If an AI does not have
      enough high quality data, it can’t properly recognise all of the patterns.
