      Technology is coming to schools at varied speeds. Still, even the most old-fashioned teachers cannot avoid the
      fact that educational tools relying on modern technology are slowly becoming an essential part of everyday life in
      schools. Concepts like learning analytics, intelligent tutors, artificial intelligence and machine learning are
      frequently mentioned when the classroom of tomorrow is discussed. So, what is the role of the teacher in all this?
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading__h2 heading__light">
      Teachers Are Human Too...
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <img src="/img/blog1_image.jpg" alt="A character controlling a robot" class="paragraph__img">Naturally, the
      teachers act
      as catalysts in bringing the new technology to classrooms. Or
      actually, depending on their autonomy, they usually have at least some role in deciding on what tools their
      students use. With all options out there, how do they decide the most pedagogically effective and motivating
      tools? A study, conducted by a workgroup lead by Professor Thomas Naps, reported that the most important factor
      for teachers, when deciding what educational tools to use, was the amount of time saved for them. Not
      effectiveness, not features, not students’ experiences, but the amount of teachers’ time that the tool saved. And
      with larger and larger classrooms, this is very human.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      The most important role of the teacher regarding technology is to work together with it. Now, that could sound
      like an understatement of teacher’s role, but I think it is in fact the opposite. We should accept the fact that
      technology can perform many things better than them. And by better, I mean faster and more reliably. For example,
      assessing a week’s worth of math problems can be done in seconds, and visualizing the results only a second more.
      Technology does not get tired and does not make human errors. So, should we gradually replace teachers?
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading__h2 heading__light">
      ...And That Is Why We Need Them
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <img src="/img/blog1_image2.jpg" alt="Teacher with his students" class="paragraph__img paragraph__img__right">
      Of course not – or not in the near future anyway. Although technology is better at some things, humans are still
      superior in other ways. Providing individual tutoring is an excellent example of this. Teachers are experts in
      dealing with students, and providing personal guidance is something the machines are not going to be able to
      compete with, at least not for a while. But what the technology can do, is to help teachers in identifying the
      students with problems that need solving. Learning analytics (and AI and all that) can be a real solution for
      this, if they are provided in a useful manner and for teachers, who know why and how to work with them.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Because of this, we should adapt a practical approach to learning analytics. The teachers are in general not that
      interested in the technology behind the analytics, but instead they want to have real-time information about their
      students’ learning. If teachers are provided with information like this, we can have tutors equipped with
      pedagogical skills and with exact knowledge on who to help and with what. So, we do still need teachers in the
      21st century, maybe more than ever. But we need teachers who understand technology. And moreover, we need
      technology that understands teachers.
