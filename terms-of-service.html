      <p class="paragraph">
        <i>Version: June 30, 2020</i>

        agreement regarding the use of the service. Customer is also responsible that the users in its organization use
        the service in accordance with these terms.</p>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Changes to the service and these terms</h4>

        service or in some other manner, as Eduten considers suitable. Changes become effective on the notified date,
        unless otherwise provided. If the change concerns pricing or significant changes in the features of the service,

        personal and non-transferable license to use the service for its own internal educational purposes. The customer
        (including its users) agrees to use the service according to these terms and applicable laws. If Eduten has
        reason to believe that the customer or a user has not followed these terms or the applicable laws, Eduten may
        delete or limit the user rights or conduct other means it considers necessary.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">A customer and a user cannot (a) use or try to use another user’s account without his/her and
        Eduten’s permission; (b) copy, modify or create derivative works of the service, it’s content or technology
        relating to it; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise try to derive the source code of the
        service or its technology; (d) remove any intellectual property right notices from the service; (e) create a

        license to use to a third party without Eduten’s prior written consent.</p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">Registration and user accounts</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">The use of the service requires that a customer organization (e.g. school, education
        institution, university) concludes an agreement with Eduten relating to the use of the service and the account
        is registered and user names created for the service. The number of the users and the features included in the
        service may depend on the agreement and subscription level.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">During the registration Eduten must be provided with required details of the user and the
        organization customer. The customer is responsible for giving accurate and truthful information and update the
        information when necessary for creating and maintaining a user account in the service. Login and password
        details are always personal.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The customer must make sure that its users maintain the login and password details in a
        secure manner. Login and password should never be provided to anyone else and a person should never use another
        person’s login and password. If the customer or a user believes or knows that the confidentiality of his/her
        login and password has been compromised, he/she should inform about it to Eduten without delay. Eduten has the
        right to delete or limit user access, if Eduten justifiably believes that the confidentiality of the user
        account has been compromised or the user does not follow these terms or otherwise acts in bad faith.</p>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Increasing the amount of student accounts</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">The initial amount of student accounts is defined in a purchase order or an agreement between
        Eduten and the customer. If the customer adds student accounts in excess of the above limit, Eduten may invoice
        the subscription fee for the additional users until the end of the current subscription period. The subscription
        fee for the next subscription period will be automatically increased to reflect the higher amount of users.</p>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Personal data and privacy</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">With regards personal data where the customer is considered the data controller, the customer
        is liable for fulfilling all obligations a data controller has under applicable privacy laws and regulations
        (e.g. ensuring that there is a legal basis for processing personal data, acquiring necessary consents from data
        subjects, maintaining and making available required privacy policies and complying with other record-keeping
        obligations of the data controller). Customer is also responsible for making sure that it has a lawful basis to
        transfer or provide personal data to Eduten or enter it to Eduten’s service, if that is required under an
        agreement. Customer is liable to hold Eduten harmless for any third party claims, damages or administrative
        sanctions caused by customer’s non-compliance with data controller’s obligations, even if such demands or claims
        were directed to Eduten.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">To the extent that customer is considered a data controller and Eduten a data processor in
        the meaning as given in EU General Data Protection Regulation, the Eduten Data Processing Terms shall also be
        applied and are considered an integral part of an agreement between the parties. To the extent there is any
        conflict between these terms and the Eduten Data Processing Terms, these terms shall take precedence.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Eduten collects and processes personal data in accordance with its own privacy policy, an up
        to date version can be found on Eduten’s website.</p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">Content created or provided by the users</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">If a customer or any of its users enter or create content in the service while using it, the
        intellectual property rights relating to such content is owned by the customer or applicable user. However,
        Eduten has an unlimited, worldwide and transferable right to use the content for providing the service to the
        customer or for any other purpose. Eduten has also right to generate aggregate and anonymous data from data
        entered by a customer or otherwise relating to customer’s use of the service. Aggregate and anonymous data are
        data from where it is not possible to identify a person and that is not considered personal data. Eduten may use
        this aggregate and anonymous data for its business purposes and it is considered data owned by Eduten. A
        customer is not responsible for Eduten’s use of aggregate and anonymous data.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The customer and user is responsible that it has a right to enter the content into the
        service and that the content it has entered does not violate any laws or third party rights and is otherwise
        lawful. For a justified reason, Eduten has a right to delete, modify or restrict the content entered by the user
        into the service.</p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">Intellectual property rights</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">The service and content relating to it are protected by copyright and other intellectual
        property right laws and are and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Eduten or its licensors, as the
        case may be. An agreement between Eduten and a customer does not constitute a sale or transfer of ownership to
        Eduten’s or its licensors intellectual property rights. The customer is only granted a limited license to use
        the intellectual property in its internal operations in accordance with these terms.</p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">Using the service</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">Use of the service requires a browser and an internet connection. The service can be used
        with compatible desktop and mobile browsers. Even if the service has been tested on different devices, browsers
        and operating environments, Eduten cannot provide any warranties that it will function error-free on all
        possible devices, browsers and operating environments.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The customer is responsible at its own cost to acquire and maintain necessary devices,
        software and internet connections required for the use of the service. Eduten does not guarantee that the
        application can be used specifically with the customer’s device, software and internet connection. Eduten is not
        responsible of the possible outages or disconnections of the application for instance due to updates, technical
        issues or problems or other similar reasons. Eduten is not responsible for any damages caused by or relating to
        use or inability to use the application.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Eduten aims to make sure that the service meets the industry standards relating to data
        security. However, Eduten is not responsible for any damages caused by deficiency in data security or malware.
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">Limitation of liability</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">The customer uses the application at its own risk. Even if Eduten has used great care to
        develop and maintain the service, and has taken due care regarding the accuracy, completeness and up-to-dateness
        of data contained by it, Eduten cannot provide any warranties that the service would operate error-free or that
        the data contained by it would be accurate, complete and up to date. The service is provided to the customer on
        “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. Furthermore, Eduten does not represent or warrant that the service is fit for
        customer’s specific purposes. The customer should evaluate prior to use of the service that it is fit for the
        customer’s intended purpose.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Eduten is not liable for any indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages or
        administrative fines caused by violation of these terms, including loss of revenue or profit, business
        interruptions and loss of data. Furthermore, Eduten is not responsible for any claims made by or damages
        suffered by third parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these terms and conditions, Eduten’s
        aggregate liability arising out of or relating to breach of contract, tort, warranty or otherwise shall in no
        event exceed the total sum paid by customer for the service within the six (6) month period prior to the cause
        of the claim. These limitations of Eduten’s liability are applied to the extent possible under mandatory
        provisions of applicable laws.</p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">Support and maintenance</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">Eduten may from time to time publish new versions or functions of the service, which may
        correct defects in the application or contain new features. Due to this, Eduten is entitled to temporarily
        restrict or limit the use of or access to the service. Eduten aims to schedule the maintenance updates in a
        manner that causes as little harm to the customer as reasonably possible.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Eduten provides user support as responses to customer’s support requests submitted via phone
        or email to the designated contact person. Support requests may be submitted via email at any time, and via
        telephone during customer service hours. Eduten will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
        responses without any specific target times.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">User support is provided in English or Finnish.</p>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Service level agreement</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">This Service Level Agreement applies to a purchase order or an agreement between Eduten and
        the
        customer. Eduten may modify this Service Level Agreement from time to time by posting such amended Service Level
        Agreement to Eduten's site.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">During the term of the agreement between Eduten and the customer Eduten will use reasonable
        efforts to achieve a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99% for any calendar month. “Downtime” means the time
        in which the service is not capable of being accessed or used by the customer, as monitored by Eduten. “Monthly
        Uptime Percentage” means the total number of minutes in a calendar month minus the number of minutes of Downtime
        suffered in a calendar month, divided by the total number of minutes in a calendar month. The following are not
        counted as Downtime for the purpose of calculating Monthly Uptime Percentage: (a) Service unavailability caused
        by
        scheduled maintenance or emergency maintenance of the platform used to provide the applicable service (Eduten
        aims
        to provide 12 hours' advance notice of scheduled scheduled maintenance that may cause more than a minor effect
        to
        the use of the service. The notice may be delivered through the user interface of the service or by other
        means.);
        or (b) Service unavailability caused by events outside of the direct control of Eduten or its subcontractor(s),
        including any force majeure event, the failure or unavailability of customer’s devices, systems, local networks,
        the Internet, and the failure of any other technology or equipment used to connect to or access the service.</p>

      <h4 class="heading__h4">Term and effects of termination</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">The term of the agreement is defined in the agreement concluded between the parties. Unless
        otherwise agreed, the agreement shall remain in effect until terminated with a written notice by either party.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">In addition to the above, for a justified reason Eduten is entitled to restrict the use or
        support or terminate the agreement between the parties by providing a written notification to the customer at
        least one (1) month in advance. Eduten may also terminate the agreement, if payments for the use of service are
        delayed for more than two (2) months.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">A party is also entitled to terminate an agreement in whole or in part in the event that the
        other party fails to comply with any material term of an agreement or these terms, provided that such failure is
        not cure, to the extent the failure is curable, within fourteen (14) days after the notice of the breach was
        provided.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">When the agreement relating to the use of the service is terminated or expires, terminates or
        expires also the right to use the service. The terms and conditions of an agreement which by their nature and
        purpose are intended to survive termination, shall survive any termination or expiration of an agreement.</p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">Applicable law and dispute resolution</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">These terms and an agreement between the parties shall be governed by and construed in
        accordance with the laws of Finland, without regard to its conflict of laws rules and principles.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Any dispute arising between the parties will be settled by amicable settlement. Failing
        amicable settlement within thirty (30) days of the dispute being referred to the settlement, the dispute will be
        finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Finnish Central Chamber of
        Commerce by one (1) sole arbitrator appointed in accordance with those Rules. The arbitration shall be held in
        Turku, Finland and the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. The Parties agree to keep
        confidential all information, documents and material relating to the arbitral proceedings as well as the
        arbitration award. Eduten shall, however, have the right to bring up any claim related to a due receivable from
        the customer in the district court where the customer is domiciled.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">If the user is considered as a consumer domiciled in the EU, it cannot be deprived of the
        rights granted to him/her by the mandatory consumer protection laws of his/her country of domicile. A consumer
        may always institute proceedings in the district court of its domicile.</p>
      <h4 class="heading__h4">Other terms</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">Eduten is entitled to employ subcontractors to fulfil its obligations under an agreement and
        it is liable to customer for all acts of its subcontractors as for its own acts.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Eduten shall not be deemed to be in breach of an agreement, or otherwise be liable to
        customer, for any failure to perform, or any delay in performance, caused by a reason beyond Eduten’s control
        (force majeure events).</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Unless otherwise agreed, a party does not have the right to transfer an agreement or rights
        and obligations related to it, entirely or partly, to a third party without the other party’s prior written
        acceptance. However, a party may assign an agreement or rights and obligations related to it without the other
        party’s acceptance in connection with any merger, sale of business or similar transaction.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">These terms and the additional agreed upon terms in an agreement contain the entire agreement
        between the parties and supersede all prior communication, discussions and agreements relating to the subject
        matter.</p>
